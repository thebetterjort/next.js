    <h3>1. Getting into this mess</h3>
    <p>
      What brings somebody to decide to grow the ocean inside of their house?
      What type of person decides to put so much time and money into an often
      times rearly viewed conversational piece. I decided to travel from
      Northwest Arkansas to Columbia, Missouri to find out this answer.
    </p>
    <h4>Traveling 600 miles for answers</h4>
    <p>
      An old college friend, a Mizzou graduate has been setting up and maintaing
      tanks for years. His current job is to handle waterflow and basically
      engineers water systems for a living. My friend is an expert on water
      systems, so when he said "I have a tank and stand for you" I was elated,
      but petrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend is a mathmatically driven soul. Scientific until the day he dies
      completely contrasts my shoot from the hip approach to life. He is
      somebody that you meet and you say, "smart as hell". At the sametime, you
      walk inside of his house and he has all sorts of plantlife growing inside
      and outside of his house. I would call him a modern hippy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no doubt that I will be in good hands as I walk (excuse me,
      crawl) through this project. I thought as soon as I visited my friend I
      would have a better sense of what I needed and have an Amazon shopping
      cart ready to go. I was wrong.
    </p>
    <h4>Tank Selection</h4>
    <p>
      My friend gave me a 72 gallon bow front. It came with a stand that we had
      to reinforce because it had seen a better time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tank fit into my Tesla Model 3, but unforntately was not able to get
      the stand. That is coming up in the coming weeks.
    </p>
    <h3>What I've learned on day 1</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The bigger the tank the easier it is to manage.</li>
      <li>A sump is a tank that goes underneath your visible tank.</li>
      <li>
        The most important component when first starting out is something called
        a protein skimmer
      </li>
      <li>Water dissolves but salt does not.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Next steps:</h3>
    <p>Research protein skimmers and things that go in sumps</p>
